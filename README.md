# Scanner
This is my first c++ project. As a freshman who just learned C++(in CSC3002 2018 spring semester), 
I proudly presented the whole project here. 

This project is the program like a scanner. The original intention of our idea is to build an 
efficient tool for students to submit their handwriting homework. 

This repository contains all of the code. If you want to see the integral application, 
you can go to another repository and download the ZIP file directly.

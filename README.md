# Scanner
This is my first c++ project. As a freshman who just learned C++(in CSC3002 2018 spring semester), 
I proudly presented the whole project here. 

This project is the program like a scanner. The original intention of our idea is to build an 
efficient tool for students to submit their handwriting homework. The main part of our project 
can be divided into three parts; First, I applied the Hough transform to detect the edge of the 
A4 paper in the picture. In addition, I designed a page which enable the client to manually 
select the paper corner to make up the inaccuracy of the first algorithm. Second, I designed 
two algorithms which can enhance the handwriting of the scanned paper. Finally, I can export 
the scanned document into a single pdf form. In addition to the main function of our project, 
I pay a lot effort to make this product more user friendly because our primary goal is to make students submit their homework easier.

This repository contains all of the code. If you want to see the integral application, 
you can go to another repository and download the ZIP file directly.
